# Trusted Advisor
* The book
   - "trusted advisor" Well known term that was already widely used
   - First book 20 years before this, but very different because of profound impact of digitalization
   - Digital has profound impacts, but not the basics and dynamics of personal trust. Adapt digital to trust
   - Leadership is more about ability to influence, not charisma
   - Institutional trust became way more important
   - Trust is a very overlapping term in many sectors
   - Book is primarily about _interpersonal trust_
   - Focus on how trust is created
   - if trust is down, is it because less willingness to trust, or actually less trustworthiness?
   - Def. Trust: One kind of relationship between 2 persons. Increases if 1 person (the truster) increases risk by trusting the other persion,
     and the trustee becomes more trustworthy
   - Sole focus on trustworthiness is a mistake

* What is a trusted advisor?
  _There are levels to advisory_
  - Database of answers
  - Find solutions (the problem is seldom what the client says it is)
  - Broad strategy issues
  - Trusted advisor - all issues are open for discussion and exploration.
  The trusted advisor is a person the clients turn to as problems arise.
  The important part is to shift to any of the levels any time, not the amount of hours you spend on the levels

 | Relationship       | Focuses on                | Energy spent on                    | client reveices             | Indicators of success |

  - networking instead of just one trusted relationship
* Earning trust

* How to give advice
  - Advice giving is almost never a logical process, but an emotional duett.
  - Need to earn the right to be critical
  - need to take sensitivity, emotions and politics into account
** _The clients perspective_
  - Can enter a consultant relationship with anxiety
  - An advisor usually reveils problems. That can be seen as creating more problems, if conveyed incorrectly.
  - Looking for reassurance, calming fear, sparking confidence.
  - Don't like being told what to do, unless advisor shows that they understand and respect them
    - Deep listening, take the time to understand the situation
  - Wants to feel in charge
  - primarily wants reasons, not instructions
  - Advisor shoud explain on eye-level with the client (regarding the skill/experience level in the matter)
** _Finding the right words_
  - prefer soft over hard phrasing
  - turn assertions into questions
  - Avoid situations where someone has to confess weakness
    - E.g. "Did everyone understand that? " vs "Have i made myself clear?"
    - "Would you like to stay on this point, or move to the next one?"
  - Trusted advisor assumes responsibility for mutual understanding
  - Avoid starting with Why?, has a judgemental edge. Strive for curiosity not judgement.
  - Rehearse a client conversation to understand how you are perceived
    - Rehease with a friend, colleague
    - Take a video
** _The teaches skills_
  - Where is the student starting from? For what messages are they ready? What do they believe in?
  - A lot of questioning and listening
  - Take on a journey of discovery
  - Socratic teaching
    - Why do you think we have this problem?
    - What would you do differently?
    - What advantages do the options have?
    - How do you think the relevant players would react?
    - Have you considered the adverse consequences of such an action?
    - Other people have encountered the following dificulties, how do you think we get around it?
    - What benefits do you see?
** _Dealing with client politics_
  - Make the client feel like it was their idea
  - Avoid taking a stance early
  - we are "A guide through the reasoning", show perspectives
  A good process for the advisor to follow is
  1. Give them their options
  2. Give them the education about the options
  3. Give them a reccomendation
  4. Let them choose
  - Many people are involved
  - Helpful to get all players on board beforehand, when a group decision is made
  - Conflicting agendas and schedules are also the advisors responsibility
** _Customizing your approach_
  - Consulting is a /performing/ art.
  - "The essence of advice-giving is the ability to design a process and means of interaction that fits each client situation".
  - Understand preferred style of interaction
* The rules of relationship building
- Tend to distinguish from our clients
- Effect can be they cut off our humanity, hindering the communication
** Key principles in relationship building
1. Go first
   + Give a favor to earn a favor
   + Need to take a risk
2. illustrate, don't tell
   + What you claim about yourself will always be perceived sceptically
   + Create opportunities to demonstrate, that you have something to contribute
   + Demonstrate that you
     1. Have listened to what the client has said
     2. have appreciated the importance the client has assigned to what they've been saying
     3. understand the unique aspects of their situation
     4. understand their business
     5. be a comfortable and supportive person to work with
     6. are able to make an unique contribution
     7. can be trusted to keep your word
     8. have experience in dealing with their problem
     Exercise: Pick 3 points that are most important, think about how you demonstrate them.
3. Listen for what's different, not for what's familiar
   What makes this person different from other clients?
   "What clients want" is a dangerous phrase, because clients want to be seen as individuals.
4. Be sure your advice is sought
   - provide affirmation, approval, support and appreciation along with your support
5. Earn the right to offer advice
   Be aware of stages in the relationship
   Three parts
   1. Understanding the clients situation
   2. Understanding how the client feels about it
   3. Convince the client that that we have achieved the previous two points
6. Keep asking
   - People tend to hint, and not communicate clearly.
   - Ask, and listen can not be emphasised enough
7. Say what you mean
   - Misunderstanding can be a big source of missed trust
8. When you need help, ask for it
   - Don't portray an image of complete mastery
   - Keeping the focus on the clients problem, builds trust
   - Demands are resented, requests for help are met with a positive response
9. Show an interest in the person
   - Keep them talking about themselves, to learn as much as possible how to adjust your communication
   - Invokes the feeling of "this person understands me"
   - Take notes
10. Use compliments, not flattery
   - Specific enough, sincere
11. Show appreciation

_Digital age_
Immitate, facilitate, and recreate the primal sense of being face-to-face with someone.
Suggestions to personalize digital communications
1. Guard against defaulting to the lowest emotional bandwith of communication
2. Exploit the capabilities of a given communications technology
3. Compensate for the limitations of the chosen technology
4. Make in-person meetings in the beginning
5. Brake the walls of your technology (e.g. find out the weather in a different locations)
6. Do your digital homework (find information about your communication partners)
7. Humanize yourself (give bits information about yourself)
* The Importance of mindsets
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or /mindsets/.
The most important ones are
1. Ability to focus on the other person
   - "You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
     goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"
   - This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
     (first you need to give /others/ what they want, in order to get what /you/ want.)
   - Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
   _Impediments_:
   - We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
   - It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
     and political depth
   - Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
   - To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
     because you stay focused on your own achievement
   - /Empathetic listening/ is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
     connect to how the other person feels.
2. Self confidence
   - Insecurity leads to loosing trust
   - Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
3. Ego strength
   - focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
   - don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
   - taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
   - (Cites Brene Brown)
   - Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
   - Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
   - Never engage the client in an argument
   - reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
4. Curiosity
   - "The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"
   - focus on the unknown
   - attitute that drives the opportunity to contribute
5. Inclusive professionalism
   We should not distinguish ourselves from the clients
   This would reinforce wrong believes such as
   - our job is to solve problems, rather than to help solve problems
   - advisors control client interactions and relationships, as opposed to inhabiting them jointly.
   - joint responsibility for the effectiveness of work
6. Principled behaviour
   + Relationships vs transactions
     - Nothing wrong with transactional collaboration, key is to give choice
     - Relationships force to focus, and be selective in whom you build relationships
   + Long term vs short term perspectives
     - Short term focus and priority on self-interest harm long-term perspectives
     - Long term are a series of short-term goals, both will be maximized by focus on long-tearm goals.
   + Integrity
     - Metavalue defined by Consistency on other values
     - consistency is sometimes more important than which values you pick
* Sincerety or technique?
- You can use techniques and be sincere
- Sincerity is crutial to trust and relationships
- What if you don't care sincerely?
  + Serve the client without getting close (unfulfilling work, definitely not recommended)
  + Keep serving and try to fake it (not recommended)
    + You can not inward out (your sincerity affecting your actions),
    but have to start acting as if you care. This can lead to your behaviour being
    indistinguishable from genuine care, either to you or to your client
    + Consistency is then key
  + Pass on to other colleague (sometimes a very good option)
  + Drop the client (reputation before revenue)
    Before:
    + Have you tried everything you know to relate to the client? 
    + Put the issue in perspective
    + If it's a tangible problem, raise it with the engagement manager
- The trick is to avoid all tricks.
- In relationships, there are no win-loose or loose win situations, only win-win or loose-loose.
  If, it's a loose-loose, it's better for both to step away
** Client or friend?
   - Unprofessional not to show an interested in a client on a personal level
   - Socializing is not necessary, but being sociable definitely is
** Social media
   - Neither good or bad for trust. The range of tools is just broader for building (but also diminishing) trust.
   - A mechanistic view on social media ("networking" by spamming loosely personalized messages) is inherently insincere
   - To earn trust, you must bet on the long term benefit of the relationship

Takeaway: Focus on journey instead of destination
* The structure of trust building
Formal approach
5 stage trust development process
* The trust equation
Four primary components of trustworthiness: words, actions, emotions and motives.
_The trustworthiness equation_
- $T$ - Trustworthiness 
- $C$ - Credibility
- $R$ - Reliability
- $I$ - Intimacy
- $S$ - Self-orientation

$$T = \frac{C+R+I}{S}$$
_Trust-realms_
| Realm         |
|---------------|
| Words         | 
| credibility   | 
| truthfullness |
| credentials   |

- Key: Trust has multiple dimensions (you can trust expertise, but distrust your motives)
- Winning trust demands that you do well on all four dimensions.
- Address your weaknesses
** Credibility
- The one dimension of trust most often achieved
- Content expertise + presence
- Be credible, and illustrate (not assert) this
- rational (accuracy, believability) and emotional (honesty, completeness) components
*** comparison rational vs emotional credibility
    |                 | rational                        | emotional                           |
    |-----------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
    | characteristics | accuracy                        | completeness                        |
    | response        | believability, not telling lies | honesty, telling truths, completely |
    | testimonial     | direct experience               | direct experience                   |
    We tend to appeal directly to rationality, without enhancing the emotional side.
    Excel at: Anticipating needs, and speaking about needs that are not commonly articulated.
    _Final tips on enhancing credibility_
    1. Figure out how to tell as much truth as possible without harming others
    2. Don't tell lies or exaggerate, ever
    3. Avoid saying things that can be construed as lies.
    4. Speak with expression, not monotonically. Show your energy
    5. Don't just cite references. You can also connect your clients if it's beneficial.
    6. If you are unsure, admit it quickly and empathically.
    7. Have them know your credentials. be careful with adjectives.
    8. Relax. You know more than you think you do.
    9. Make sure that you do your homework about the client.
    10. Don't show off.
    11. Love your topic - it will show.
** Reliability
   - Clients think you are dependable and behave consistently
   - Improves the better you know the person
   - Explicit action-orientation (as opposed to credibility)
   - Emotional aspect: the extent to which we seem to anticipate the other persons habits, expectations, routines and quirks
   - Repeated experiences of expectations fulfilled
   - Make promises and deliver on them
   - Consistency in terms of the client's preferences
   - Aim at client based familiarity (e.g. sending meeting material beforehand, consistently)
   Final thoughts
   1. make specific commitments around small things
   2. send meeting materials in advance
   3. meetings should have clear goals, ensure they are met
   4. Use clients look and feel around terminology, style, formats, hours etc.
   5. Review agendas with your clients
   6. Re-confirm scheduled events before they happen, inform of changes on time
** Intimacy
   - Biggest sources of differentiation in trustworthiness are intimacy and low self-orientation
   - Know how to emphasize with someone, but also know how to communicate this
   - not afraid to be vulnerable, not afraid to ask tough questions and take on emotional risk
   - A safe haven for tough issues
   - People can get very personal, intimate and irrational
   - Intimacy is about emotional closeness /concerning the issue at hand/
   - Mutually increasing
   - More about /who we are/ than other aspects of trust.
   Suggestions
   1. Be not afraid. Intimacy requires courage for everyone involved.
   2. Candor is not necessarily intimacy.
   3. Show that you have a different angle, ask questions unheard of from other consultants.
      Both parties will have fun and learn
   4. Test if you are about to cross the line. Ask if the client would even want to discuss
      an intimate issue with you, by putting yourself in their shoes.
      Can the client exit the situation while saving face? Is it the correct time, topic and phrasing?
   5. Practice phrasing of difficult questions, messages etc.
   6. Don't overrate the downside risk. It is often overstated and sometimes, it is actually your personal risk.
   7. You have to make the first step.
** Self-orientation
   No greater source of distrust, if we make the impression that we just care about ourselves.
   Threats to client-focus, and temptations for self-orientation
   1. selfishness
   2. self-consciousness
   3. need to appear on top of things
   4. a desire to look intelligent
   5. A to-do list on our mind that is a mile long
   6. A desire to jump to the solution
   7. A desire to win that exceeds the desire to help the client
   8. a desire to be right
   9. A desire to be seen to be right
   10. A desire to be seen as adding value
   11. Fears of various kinds
   In short: Any kind of preoccupation with our own agenda.
   _The client recognizes this through_ 
   1. Tendency to relate a story to yourself
   2. Finishing sentences for the other to quickly
   3. Need to feel empty spaces in conversations
   4. Need to feel witty, intelligent
   5. Inability do answer directly to a direct question
   6. Unwillingness to say "i don't know"
   7. Name-dropping of other clients
   8. A recitation of qualifications
   9. A tendency to give answers too quickly
   10. Tendency to want to have the last word
   11. Closed-ended questions early on
   12. Putting forward hypothesis before hearing the client's or problem statements
   13. Passive listening
   14. Watching the client as if they were a computer monitor: A source of data?
   _How do we represent low self-orientation_
   1. Letting the client fill in the empty spaces
   2. Asking the client what's behind a certain issue
   3. Using open ended questions
   4. Not giving answers unless you have earned  the right to do so
   5. Focus on defining the problem, not guessing the solution
   6. Reflective listening (e.g. summarizing what we heard)
   7. Saying you don't know, when you don't know
   8. Acknowledge the feelings of the client with respect
   9. Learn how to tell the clients story before we write our own
   10. Listening without distractions
   11. Resisting with confidence the clients invitation to provide a solution too early on.
   12. Trusting the ability to add value after listening.
   13. Taking most responsibility of failed communications.
   Other:
   - Make their concerns your concerns
   - Listen 1 to 1
   - Be honest with yourself about your level of interest
** Trust and relationship economics
   The trust equation can be used to evaluate a relationship.
   The cost of building new clients is much higher,
   because credibility, reliability and intimacy need time to build.
   The strongest predictor of high trust factors is the intimacy factor.
