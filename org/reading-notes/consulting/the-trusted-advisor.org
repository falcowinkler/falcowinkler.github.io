# Trusted Advisor
* The book
   - "trusted advisor" Well known term that was already widely used
   - First book 20 years before this, but very different because of profound impact of digitalization
   - Digital has profound impacts, but not the basics and dynamics of personal trust. Adapt digital to trust
   - Leadership is more about ability to influence, not charisma
   - Institutional trust became way more important
   - Trust is a very overlapping term in many sectors
   - Book is primarily about _interpersonal trust_
   - Focus on how trust is created
   - if trust is down, is it because less willingness to trust, or actually less trustworthiness?
   - Def. Trust: One kind of relationship between 2 persons. Increases if 1 person (the truster) increases risk by trusting the other persion,
     and the trustee becomes more trustworthy
   - Sole focus on trustworthiness is a mistake

* What is a trusted advisor?
  _There are levels to advisory_
  - Database of answers
  - Find solutions (the problem is seldom what the client says it is)
  - Broad strategy issues
  - Trusted advisor - all issues are open for discussion and exploration.
  The trusted advisor is a person the clients turn to as problems arise.
  The important part is to shift to any of the levels any time, not the amount of hours you spend on the levels

 | Relationship       | Focuses on                | Energy spent on                    | client reveices             | Indicators of success |

  - Individuals are allowed to be fully who they are
  - we have more chance to tune our offering to the real needs of the clients

  _Evolution of the trusted advisor role_
  - networked organizations are the norm
  - role models are harder to find
  - applications are shifting
  - networking instead of just one trusted relationship
* Earning trust
  - Never label yourself as trustworthy
  - Be empathic, think about what's most relevant to the other party
  - Trust can be lost very rapidly. Keep your self-interest in check

** _Characteristics of trust_

  12. If you are not able to trust, you are likely not trustworthy
  13. Trust is about relationships, you being in it for the long haul
* How to give advice
  - Advice giving is almost never a logical process, but an emotional duett.
  - Need to earn the right to be critical
  - need to take sensitivity, emotions and politics into account
** _The clients perspective_
  - Can enter a consultant relationship with anxiety
  - An advisor usually reveils problems. That can be seen as creating more problems, if conveyed incorrectly.
  - Looking for reassurance, calming fear, sparking confidence.
  - Don't like being told what to do, unless advisor shows that they understand and respect them
    - Deep listening, take the time to understand the situation
  - Wants to feel in charge
  - primarily wants reasons, not instructions
  - Advisor shoud explain on eye-level with the client (regarding the skill/experience level in the matter)
** _Finding the right words_
  - prefer soft over hard phrasing
  - turn assertions into questions
  - Avoid situations where someone has to confess weakness
    - E.g. "Did everyone understand that? " vs "Have i made myself clear?"
    - "Would you like to stay on this point, or move to the next one?"
  - Trusted advisor assumes responsibility for mutual understanding
  - Avoid starting with Why?, has a judgemental edge. Strive for curiosity not judgement.
  - Rehearse a client conversation to understand how you are perceived
    - Rehease with a friend, colleague
    - Take a video
** _The teaches skills_
  - Where is the student starting from? For what messages are they ready? What do they believe in?
  - A lot of questioning and listening
  - Take on a journey of discovery
  - Socratic teaching
    - Why do you think we have this problem?
    - What would you do differently?
    - What advantages do the options have?
    - How do you think the relevant players would react?
    - Have you considered the adverse consequences of such an action?
    - Other people have encountered the following dificulties, how do you think we get around it?
    - What benefits do you see?
** _Dealing with client politics_
  - Make the client feel like it was their idea
  - Avoid taking a stance early
  - we are "A guide through the reasoning", show perspectives
  A good process for the advisor to follow is
  1. Give them their options
  2. Give them the education about the options
  3. Give them a reccomendation
  4. Let them choose
  - Many people are involved
  - Helpful to get all players on board beforehand, when a group decision is made
  - Conflicting agendas and schedules are also the advisors responsibility
** _Customizing your approach_
  - Consulting is a /performing/ art.
  - "The essence of advice-giving is the ability to design a process and means of interaction that fits each client situation".
  - Understand preferred style of interaction
* The rules of relationship building
- Tend to distinguish from our clients
- Effect can be they cut off our humanity, hindering the communication
** Key principles in relationship building
1. Go first
   + Give a favor to earn a favor
   + Need to take a risk
2. illustrate, don't tell
   + What you claim about yourself will always be perceived sceptically
   + Create opportunities to demonstrate, that you have something to contribute
   + Demonstrate that you
     1. Have listened to what the client has said
     2. have appreciated the importance the client has assigned to what they've been saying
     3. understand the unique aspects of their situation
     4. understand their business
     5. be a comfortable and supportive person to work with
     6. are able to make an unique contribution
     7. can be trusted to keep your word
     8. have experience in dealing with their problem
     Exercise: Pick 3 points that are most important, think about how you demonstrate them.
3. Listen for what's different, not for what's familiar
   What makes this person different from other clients?
   "What clients want" is a dangerous phrase, because clients want to be seen as individuals.
4. Be sure your advice is sought
   - provide affirmation, approval, support and appreciation along with your support
5. Earn the right to offer advice
   Be aware of stages in the relationship
   Three parts
   1. Understanding the clients situation
   2. Understanding how the client feels about it
   3. Convince the client that that we have achieved the previous two points
6. Keep asking
   - People tend to hint, and not communicate clearly.
   - Ask, and listen can not be emphasised enough
7. Say what you mean
   - Misunderstanding can be a big source of missed trust
8. When you need help, ask for it
   - Don't portray an image of complete mastery
   - Keeping the focus on the clients problem, builds trust
   - Demands are resented, requests for help are met with a positive response
9. Show an interest in the person
   - Keep them talking about themselves, to learn as much as possible how to adjust your communication
   - Invokes the feeling of "this person understands me"
   - Take notes
10. Use compliments, not flattery
   - Specific enough, sincere
11. Show appreciation

_Digital age_
Immitate, facilitate, and recreate the primal sense of being face-to-face with someone.
Suggestions to personalize digital communications
1. Guard against defaulting to the lowest emotional bandwith of communication
2. Exploit the capabilities of a given communications technology
3. Compensate for the limitations of the chosen technology
4. Make in-person meetings in the beginning
5. Brake the walls of your technology (e.g. find out the weather in a different locations)
6. Do your digital homework (find information about your communication partners)
7. Humanize yourself (give bits information about yourself)
* The Importance of mindsets
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or /mindsets/.
The most important ones are
1. Ability to focus on the other person
   - "You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
     goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"
   - This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
     (first you need to give /others/ what they want, in order to get what /you/ want.)
   - Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
   _Impediments_:
   - We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
   - It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
     and political depth
   - Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
   - To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
     because you stay focused on your own achievement
   - /Empathetic listening/ is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
     connect to how the other person feels.
2. Self confidence
   - Insecurity leads to loosing trust
   - Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
3. Ego strength
   - focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
   - don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
   - taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
   - (Cites Brene Brown)
   - Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
   - Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
   - Never engage the client in an argument
   - reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
4. Curiosity
   - "The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"
   - focus on the unknown
   - attitute that drives the opportunity to contribute
5. Inclusive professionalism
   We should not distinguish ourselves from the clients
   This would reinforce wrong believes such as
   - our job is to solve problems, rather than to help solve problems
   - advisors control client interactions and relationships, as opposed to inhabiting them jointly.
   - joint responsibility for the effectiveness of work
6. Principled behaviour
   + Relationships vs transactions
     - Nothing wrong with transactional collaboration, key is to give choice
     - Relationships force to focus, and be selective in whom you build relationships
   + Long term vs short term perspectives
     - Short term focus and priority on self-interest harm long-term perspectives
     - Long term are a series of short-term goals, both will be maximized by focus on long-tearm goals.
   + Integrity
     - Metavalue defined by Consistency on other values
     - consistency is sometimes more important than which values you pick
* Sincerety or technique?
- You can use techniques and be sincere
- Sincerity is crutial to trust and relationships
- What if you don't care sincerely?
  + Serve the client without getting close (unfulfilling work, definitely not recommended)
  + Keep serving and try to fake it (not recommended)
    + You can not inward out (your sincerity affecting your actions),
    but have to start acting as if you care. This can lead to your behaviour being
    indistinguishable from genuine care, either to you or to your client
    + Consistency is then key
  + Pass on to other colleague (sometimes a very good option)
  + Drop the client (reputation before revenue)
    Before:
    + Have you tried everything you know to relate to the client? 
    + Put the issue in perspective
    + If it's a tangible problem, raise it with the engagement manager
- The trick is to avoid all tricks.
- In relationships, there are no win-loose or loose win situations, only win-win or loose-loose.
  If, it's a loose-loose, it's better for both to step away
** Client or friend?
   - Unprofessional not to show an interested in a client on a personal level
   - Socializing is not necessary, but being sociable definitely is
** Social media
   - Neither good or bad for trust. The range of tools is just broader for building (but also diminishing) trust.
   - A mechanistic view on social media ("networking" by spamming loosely personalized messages) is inherently insincere
   - To earn trust, you must bet on the long term benefit of the relationship

Takeaway: Focus on journey instead of destination
* The structure of trust building
Formal approach
5 stage trust development process
* The trust equation
Four primary components of trustworthiness: words, actions, emotions and motives.
_The trustworthiness equation_
- $T$ - Trustworthiness 
- $C$ - Credibility
- $R$ - Reliability
- $I$ - Intimacy
- $S$ - Self-orientation

$$T = \frac{C+R+I}{S}$$
_Trust-realms_
| Realm         |
|---------------|
| Words         | 
| credibility   | 
| truthfullness |
| credentials   |

- Key: Trust has multiple dimensions (you can trust expertise, but distrust your motives)
- Winning trust demands that you do well on all four dimensions.
- Address your weaknesses
** Credibility
- The one dimension of trust most often achieved
- Content expertise + presence
- Be credible, and illustrate (not assert) this
- rational (accuracy, believability) and emotional (honesty, completeness) components
*** comparison rational vs emotional credibility
    |                 | rational                        | emotional                           |
    |-----------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
    | characteristics | accuracy                        | completeness                        |
    | response        | believability, not telling lies | honesty, telling truths, completely |
    | testimonial     | direct experience               | direct experience                   |
    We tend to appeal directly to rationality, without enhancing the emotional side.
    Excel at: Anticipating needs, and speaking about needs that are not commonly articulated.
    _Final tips on enhancing credibility_
    1. Figure out how to tell as much truth as possible without harming others
    2. Don't tell lies or exaggerate, ever
    3. Avoid saying things that can be construed as lies.
    4. Speak with expression, not monotonically. Show your energy
    5. Don't just cite references. You can also connect your clients if it's beneficial.
    6. If you are unsure, admit it quickly and empathically.
    7. Have them know your credentials. be careful with adjectives.
    8. Relax. You know more than you think you do.
    9. Make sure that you do your homework about the client.
    10. Don't show off.
    11. Love your topic - it will show.
** Reliability
   - Clients think you are dependable and behave consistently
   - Improves the better you know the person
   - Explicit action-orientation (as opposed to credibility)
   - Emotional aspect: the extent to which we seem to anticipate the other persons habits, expectations, routines and quirks
   - Repeated experiences of expectations fulfilled
   - Make promises and deliver on them
   - Consistency in terms of the client's preferences
   - Aim at client based familiarity (e.g. sending meeting material beforehand, consistently)
   Final thoughts
   1. make specific commitments around small things
   2. send meeting materials in advance
   3. meetings should have clear goals, ensure they are met
   4. Use clients look and feel around terminology, style, formats, hours etc.
   5. Review agendas with your clients
   6. Re-confirm scheduled events before they happen, inform of changes on time
** Intimacy
   - Biggest sources of differentiation in trustworthiness are intimacy and low self-orientation
   - Know how to emphasize with someone, but also know how to communicate this
   - not afraid to be vulnerable, not afraid to ask tough questions and take on emotional risk
   - A safe haven for tough issues
   - People can get very personal, intimate and irrational
   - Intimacy is about emotional closeness /concerning the issue at hand/
   - Mutually increasing
   - More about /who we are/ than other aspects of trust.
   Suggestions
   1. Be not afraid. Intimacy requires courage for everyone involved.
   2. Candor is not necessarily intimacy.
   3. Show that you have a different angle, ask questions unheard of from other consultants.
      Both parties will have fun and learn
   4. Test if you are about to cross the line. Ask if the client would even want to discuss
      an intimate issue with you, by putting yourself in their shoes.
      Can the client exit the situation while saving face? Is it the correct time, topic and phrasing?
   5. Practice phrasing of difficult questions, messages etc.
   6. Don't overrate the downside risk. It is often overstated and sometimes, it is actually your personal risk.
   7. You have to make the first step.
** Self-orientation
   No greater source of distrust, if we make the impression that we just care about ourselves.
   Threats to client-focus, and temptations for self-orientation
   1. selfishness
   2. self-consciousness
   3. need to appear on top of things
   4. a desire to look intelligent
   5. A to-do list on our mind that is a mile long
   6. A desire to jump to the solution
   7. A desire to win that exceeds the desire to help the client
   8. a desire to be right
   9. A desire to be seen to be right
   10. A desire to be seen as adding value
   11. Fears of various kinds
   In short: Any kind of preoccupation with our own agenda.
   _The client recognizes this through_ 
   1. Tendency to relate a story to yourself
   2. Finishing sentences for the other to quickly
   3. Need to feel empty spaces in conversations
   4. Need to feel witty, intelligent
   5. Inability do answer directly to a direct question
   6. Unwillingness to say "i don't know"
   7. Name-dropping of other clients
   8. A recitation of qualifications
   9. A tendency to give answers too quickly
   10. Tendency to want to have the last word
   11. Closed-ended questions early on
   12. Putting forward hypothesis before hearing the client's or problem statements
   13. Passive listening
   14. Watching the client as if they were a computer monitor: A source of data?
   _How do we represent low self-orientation_
   1. Letting the client fill in the empty spaces
   2. Asking the client what's behind a certain issue
   3. Using open ended questions
   4. Not giving answers unless you have earned  the right to do so
   5. Focus on defining the problem, not guessing the solution
   6. Reflective listening (e.g. summarizing what we heard)
   7. Saying you don't know, when you don't know
   8. Acknowledge the feelings of the client with respect
   9. Learn how to tell the clients story before we write our own
   10. Listening without distractions
   11. Resisting with confidence the clients invitation to provide a solution too early on.
   12. Trusting the ability to add value after listening.
   13. Taking most responsibility of failed communications.
   Other:
   - Make their concerns your concerns
   - Listen 1 to 1
   - Be honest with yourself about your level of interest
** Trust and relationship economics
   The trust equation can be used to evaluate a relationship.
   The cost of building new clients is much higher,
   because credibility, reliability and intimacy need time to build.
   The strongest predictor of high trust factors is the intimacy factor.
* The development of trust
Start of in depth investigation about buidling trust.
Five distinct steps of building trust:
1. Engage
2. Listen
3. Frame
4. Envision
5. Commit

** Summary of the trust process
   | Step     | Action taken                                          | What the client feels                                                        | What the advisor gains                                       |
   |----------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Engage   | Attention becomes focused                             | It may be worth talking to this person about                                 | Earns the right to tell and hear truths                      |
   | Listen   | Ears bigger than mouth, acknoledge and affirm         | I am being both heard and understood                                        | Earns the right to suggest a problem statement or definition |
   | Frame    | The root issue is stated clearly and openly           | Yes, that is exactly the problem here                                        | Coalesces issues to move forward                             |
   | Envision | A vision of an alternate reality is sketched out      | Could we really accomplish that? That could be a really interesting outcome! | Concretises vision. Generates clarity of objective           |
   | Commit   | Steps are agreed upon, sense of commitment is renewed | I Agree, i understand what needs to be done, i'm with you, let's do it       | Allows problem resolution to begin                    |
*** Engage
    /Uses language of interest and concern/
    /Requires the skill of being credibly noticed/
    The client feels
    - There is an issue worth talking about
    - It is worth talking to the consultant about the issue
    Relevant for both new and existing relationships!
*** Listen
    /Uses language of understanding and empathy/
    /Requires the ability to understand another human being/
    Good listening is Active, incisive, conscious, involved and interactive.
    Listen for what is unspoken.
    Confirm and validate what we have heard.
    Give the experience of having been listened to.
*** Framing
    /Uses language of perspective and candor/
    /Requires creative insight and emotional courage/
    - Formulating problem statements, hypothesis, and points of view,
    built around what's important to the client.
    - Significant for trust building
    - Rarely an exclusively rational process, rather to reveal and organize
    the client's issues
*** Envision
    /Uses language of possibility/
    /Requires a spirit of colaboration and creativity/
    1. What are we really aimimg for here?
    2. What will it look like when we get there?
    3. How will we know, we are there?
    - /Manage expectations/, up or down
    - Here the clients understands and defines their goals
*** Commit
    /Uses language of joint exploration/
    /Requires the ability to generate enthusiasm, and sometimes/
    /the ability to manage overenthusiasm/
    -Help find the determination to do what is necessary.
    -Here one has to have made sure expectations have been managed accurately.
    - Help the client to understand what has to happen
    - Outline risks
* Engagement
  - Nontrivial decision for the client
  - Investment of time and energy, that is only given if some likelihood
    of a positive outcome is perceived
  - Be seen as visibly trying to customize activites to this specific client
  - Invoke a sense of "Maybe these people aren't like all the others.."
  - /Go first, illustrate and don't assert/.
  - Show that you /understand/ their wants.
*** Digital engagement
    - Engagement is most affected by the digital revolution (out of the 5 steps)
    - It's possible to start engaging digitally
    - But it requires better communication skills and sharing critical insights early on
*** Engaging with existing clients
    - Do or say things that are still suffinciently new and intriguing
    - Build on prior knowledge that you have built
    For example, approaches that...
    1. demonstrate concern about competetive developments
    2. signal an understanding of career challenges facing a particular individual
    3. might offer a solution to a specific, managerial issue
    4. demonstrate continuity and development
    It's about the right topic at the right time. Rules of thumb:
    1. introduce the topics in an order that amounts to the time the client has available.
       e.g. if the time is limited start with the urgent and end with the important.
       With more time, start with important and leave 5 mins for the urgent
    2. Don't hold back in raising a topic.
*** Engaging with new client
    Find out everything you can
    - Do some second level investigations about the people involved,
      topics you can talk to them about.
    - Good and relevant issues/topics that might be a bit risky
    Don't make the first interactions /transactional/, but similar to how you would talk to a new friend.
* The art of listening
  Why is being listened to so important?
  Not only because of the need to rationally understand the issues,
  but from a need of respect, empathy and involvement.
  Ensure is that the self-esteem of the client is protected ("i understand... now help me to understand why...")
  _Two common mistakes_
  1. Listen only to the rational
     emotional data is every bit as important as rational data
  2. Listen only passively
     send emotional colorings and nuances, not passive ~acks~
** Listening to the sequence
   ~30 to 60 seconds attention span
   Speakers will create a story with background, setup and punchline.
   Listen to the whole sequence and understand the connections.
   Listen to stories, not only facts.
*** Reflective listening, supportive listening and listening for possibility
   - Reflective listening demonstrates clarity and communicates
     that their message has been heard,
     and that the impact, implications and emotions are also well understood
   - Supportive listening demonstrates empathy, an understanding why the client feels a certain way
   - Listening for possibility demonstrates insight,
     and suggests a particular path or solution may help resolve the dilemma.
* The agenda-setting discussion
  An agenda
  - is a pre-statement, as to how a meeting should be conducted and what should be discussed.
  - , both in written and spoken form, is a formal tool for listening
  - should always be discussed
  - a powerful symbol for acting together jointly
  the client is made to feel involved
* What do good listeners do?
  _Good listeners do:_
  1. probe for clarification
  2. listen for unvoiced communications
  3. listen for the story
  4. summarise well
  5. emphasize
  6. listen for what's differnen, not for what's familiar
  7. take it all seriously
  8. spot hidden assumptions
  9. let the client get it out of their system
  10. ask "how do you feel about that?"
  11. keep the client talking "what else have you considered?"
  12. keep asking for more detail that helps them understand
  13. get rid of distractions
  14. focus on hearing the clients version first
  15. let the client tell their story their way
  16. stand in the clients shoes
  17. aks how they think you might be of help
  18. aks what the client has thought of, before telling them what they have thought of.
  19. look at (not stare at) the client as they speaks
  20. look for (in-)congruity of what the client says and body language
  21. Make it seem like the client is the only thing that matters, and they have all the time in the world
  22. Encourage by nodding head or giving a slight smile
  23. Are aware of and control their body movement.
  _Good listeners don't:_
  1. Interrupt
  2. Respond too soon
  3. Match the client points ("Well i had the same thing happen to me...")
  4. Editorialize in mid-stream ("Well that option is a non-starter...")
  5. Jump to conclusions, much less judgements
  6. Ask closed end questions for no reason
  7. Give you their ideas before hearing yours
  8. Judge you
  9. Try to solve the problem too quickly
  10. Answer calls or text messages in the course of a client meeting
* Framing the issue
  The most challenging, rewarding and difficult phase of the 5.
  Identifying the essence of the issue at hand.
** Rational framing
   Distilling a complex set of issues down to a few, critical variables.
   We are considerably limited in the number of perspective we can keep in our head at the same time.
   Use models, draw, visualize, sketch lists etc.
** Emotional framing
   If advisory relationships and conversations can get stuck in emotional backwater,
   rational framing will not unblock it.
   If you notice emptional pressure, switch to emotional level and address them immediately.
   ⚠ we are framing the /clients/ emotions.
   _Naming and claiming_
   Speaking to what before has been unsayable.
   Characterised by
   1. An acknowledgement of the difficulty of raising the issue
   2. An acceptance of responsibility for raising it
   3. A direct statement of the issue itself
   This is about taking risk, and courage.
   _Framing and blaming_
   Most initial framings (often from the clients) are full of blame.
   Blame truly get's in the way of effectively advising, because it's a waste of energy.
   The problem statement should ideally be blame-free.
   _Implementing emotional framing_
   An altitue of taking responsibility, instead of looking to blame others.
   Responsibility taking caveats:
   1. It's probably just me, but...
   2. I must have been tuned out for a moment, i'm sorry, you were saying?
   3. I'm sure you covered this before, but...
   4. I'm sorry to interrupt, but i just can't get this out of my head about...
   5. You probably thought of this already..
   6. I wish i knew, but i just don't know how to handle this concern
   7. I realize you have a strong preference about ...
   8. I'm probably thinking about this all wrong, but
   9. I'm not sure if this is on point but it occurs to me that...
   10. I may not have understood this right, so bare with me...
   11. I don't know exactly how to say this, so i hope you help me, when i wonder..
   12. I hope i am not inapprobiate by bringing this up, but...
   13. I hope you forgive my for not knowing quite how to say this, but...
* Envisioning an alternate reality
  /Jointly/ imagine what the end-result should look like,
  and adressing questions such as
  1. For what are we really aiming here?
  2. What will it look like when we get there?
  3. How will we know when we are there?
  Free's up new perspective, encouraging freedom and creativiity.
  Not absolutely necessary, but can often add the most value.
  Energizing and comforting.
  Focus on discriptive sentences, and concrete outcomes
** Summary
   - It's tempting to switch into action language after framing
   - slow down the client if they switch
* Commitment
  Final stage of trust-building (not selling).
  Client understands what is necessary to achieve the goals.
  Commitment on emotional, trust-building level (not rational)
  A conversation should contain some of these points
  1. What's gonna get in the way of getting this done?
  2. What do we intend to do about it??
  3. Who needs to be brought in the loop?
  4. Who should do what part?
  5. What information do we need?
  6. When should we check in?
  7. What are the key deadlines?

  Check back if both parties really understand the commitment.
  E.g. by assuming the devils advocate role, and going through pitfalls.
  Don't omit discussions of risks and uncertanties.
  Clients commit because of two reasons:
  - Feeling pain or energy around a topic (the usual case)
  - They are captivated by something new, different and totally appearing
** Managing expectations
  To explore what will and will not happen is important also as a trust building block
  To manage expectations well, we must
  1. Clearly articulate what we will do, and won't do
  2. Clearly articulate what the client will do, and won't do
  3. Define the boundary of the analyses we will perform
  4. Check with the client about any areas they don't want us to get involved in
  5. Identify precise working arrangements
  6. Agree on methods and frequency of communicating
  7. Decide on who should get which reports
  8. Decide how often a report should be delivered
  9. Decide how any reports will be used
  10. Decide what milestones and progress reviews are needed
  11. Decide how success will be measured, both during and after the process.

  Additional suggestions
  1. Always tell the exact truths about what you can/can't do/deliver
  2. Start the project before you've been engaged
  3. Show enthusiasm
  4. Ask the questions that are troubling you earlier than later
** Resistance to commitment
   Frequently, this is because the earlier stages have not been adequately dealt with
   Other reasons are fear and complacency.
   Fear: Facing it, by acknowledging it.
   Complacency: Expand on trust capital.
   Define commitment steps: What, who, when?
** Joint commitment
   Place the issue in context of the other work to be done for the client.
* Putting trust to work
  The 
  - Explorations of the difficulties applying the concepts and techniques discussed so far
  - How to deal with different clients and situations
  - Trust building and practical tipps
* What's so hard about all this?
  1. This is all to personally risky
     - It /is/ risky. Careful balance is the key: Awareness, focus & practice.
     - Risk is the essence of creating intimacy       
  2. It's not easy to stop worrying about yourself, and focus on others instead
     - We get a lot better if we focus on others, it helps us find ourselves
     - New ways of thinking have to be practiced
     - Requires a dedication to stay grounded and centered, and retain perspective
  3. Professional services firm teach you that content is all
     - It's common thinking, but that doesn't guarentee that it's right
     - Appealing because this approach is more quantifiable
     - But: Without trust, expertise is meaningless
  4. We can't overcome our fear of appearing stupid, or uninformed
     - Pure assertiveness can sometimes appear even more stupid or uninformed
     - Emotional intelligence: Recognize emotions in ourselfes and in others, and act upon that interpretation.
  5. It's hard to listen first. We have a hard time re-wiring our habits
     - deeply wired instincts
     - Recognize them as ingrained habits
     - Habit-breaking devices
  6. It takes a lot of courage to speak about the unspeakable
     - Realization that very often the alternative can be worse, helps
     - Risk of taking is overrated, while the risk of not taking an action is underrated
     - "The client's fear is your opportunity, whereas your fear is your enemy'
  7. It comes to close to the line of invading the private
     - If it's invading the private, it is too much!
     - Naming and claiming, gentle phrasing and giving people an out are important here
  8. This approach discounts too heavily the value of good expertise
     - No trust, expertise doesn't get through
  9. It all sounds too moralistic
     - Ask yourself, if trust as a strategy works.
  10. This process sounds slooow, my budget won't allow for this!
      - False assumptions:
        1. Clients won't pay for counceling 
        2. Advising and trust-building not only about the current issue at hand does not lead to future revenue and opportunities
  11. My client want's me to focus on the work at hand
      - Ask to confirm this observation
      - Listen closely to the answer, and prepare to deliver based upon it
      - If it stays that way, you can focus on becoming a trusted advisor elsewhere
  12. It's risky to take position, until im absolutely sure
      - Not taking a position sacrifices an enormous range of options for helping a client
      - Diminishes the possibility of brainstorming, stimulating conversation etc...
      - Risk aversion surrenders many positives
  13. I took a position and now im stuck with it. To change my view would destroy my credibility
      - Our credibility is more at stake if we stick to an incorrect opinion.
  14. It's hard to be this humble!
      - Humility is not a weakness.
  In summary: The risks are overrated.
** Why we all rush to action too soon
A mistake made more often than any others. Why?
1. The human tendency to focus on ourselves
2. The belief that we are only selling content
3. The desire for tangibility
4. The search for validation
** Risk
The #1 reason why we don't do this "trust stuff":
/"Well, i wouldn't do that. It's just too risky."/
Nearly every techique and concept so far is often perceived as risky and thus infeasible.
Often /business risk/ is often, after close examination, /personal risk/.
*** Reasons for perceived risk
| Perceived Risk to | You can't                                                                             | Because the client wants                       |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
| Credibility       | Hypothesise, say you don't know, focus on framing the problem                         | An anwswer, confidence, expertise              |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
| Intimacy          | - Stay with listening too long, without moving to action,                             | Action, a professional relationship,           |
|                   | get too personal, talk about emotions, go off agenda, talk about difficult situations | just the facts, progress, not to be embarassed |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
A buying decision is highly emotional, almost always, from both sides.
** Managing your own emotions
The higher the stakes, the harder it is to take the simple small error-correction steps.
Ego-fulfilling thoughts overrule the calm, cool reflective state.
Self-centered fear is the primary reason for a focus on ourselves.
Emotions and desires we must learn to control include
1. Wanting to take credit for an idea
2. Wanting to fill blank airtime with content
3. Playing to our own insecurity by feeling we have to get all our credentials out there
4. Wanting to put a cap on the problem, so we can solve it later, without the pressure
5. wanting to hedge our answers in case we are wrong
6. Wanting too soon to relate our own version of the client's story or problem
* Differing client types
Generalising clients is tempting, but dangerous and wrong.
How can we regognize and deal with the various type of clients?

1. Work in advance on what is different about this client, and what might be different about you in this situation.
   Make sure that there is complete understanding on what you are supposed to do for a client, before walking into a meeting.
2. As you look at the client, force yourself to ask three questions
   - What is the client's prevailing personal motivation?
   - What is their personality?
   - How does the state of their organization affect their world view?
3. When thinking about a clients pervailing personal motivation, which comes first?
   - the need to excel
   - the need to take action and achieve results
   - The need to understand and analyse before deciding
   - The need to drive consensus
   Tailor your conversation to a specific outcome
4. Figure out why you might truly like this client as a person
5. Use the trust equation. Look at how the client weighs the factors.
   Ask:  How highly does the client value...
   - me for my objective unbiased clear opinions? (Credibility)
   - me for my track record, for my integrity of doing what i said i'd do?
   - the fact that they can talk to me just about anything without fear of embarassement
   - the fact that i am on their side, that i am in this for them?
   Rational <-> Emotional? 
** Some difficult client types, and how to respond
1. "Just the facts"
   Don't be fooled: This is a plea to be understood. 
   Speak in the clients language. 
   Use clarifying and confirming statements.
2. "I'll get back to you"
   This is typically a client nervous about commitments on the spot, conservative, afraid of being wrong.
   Make that process easier for them. Legitimize their desire for "soak time".
3. "You're the expert, dummy"
   They are giving in to their inclination to dominate you. Give back value in the form of a number of hypothesis.
4. "Let me handle that"
   The language of a client that doesn't trust you. Apply the trust process.
   It can also be that the client doesn't trust anyone -> Naming and claiming.
5. "Let's go through this again"
   Frame via alternatives: Clients like this are most comfortable in the detail-oriented realm.
   This might mask a desire to control things. The goal is to make the situation feel controllable.
6. "You don't understand"
   Might be a desire to feel special. Don't try to win the battle, acknowledge your differences and ask questions
7. "The enemy's enemy is my friend"
   These clients love politics. Speak their language. Don't debate the value of what they are saying.
   Make politics a content issue and talk about it freely.
8. "Just like, you know, come on. Make it happen"
   Skills not in the verbal area, but often they have balancing strength. Help them, give them voice.
   Write down, make lists, allow them to rank things etc.
9. "Oh by the way... i probably should have..."
   Are you consistently missing out? It could be a personal issue, or a label for you.
   Ask for a private meeting, assume that you have a label. Use naming and claiming, ask to put them in your shoes.
   

* The role of trust in business development
Many professionals are terrible negotiators,
because selling has a negative connotation (or stereotype).

Imagine youself as the buyer of a complex and emotionally charged service (e.g. will).
You are anxious as the service is important to you and you know less about the price than the other party.
Imagine if the seller
- Seems to have your best interest at heart
- Seeks to understand your interest
- Offers advice that is useful to you
- Doesn't seem to try to get you to buy
- Is driven by your calender, not theirs
- Isn't wedded to this transaction
- Is transparent and honest

This sounds familiar to values of client delivery! So we don't have to cross over to the dark side.
** The goal of sales
The goal is still to help the client. We must be willing to
- Stop trying to close the deal
- Be transparent and consistent about our pricing
- Be much less attached to the outcome (view sale as a byproduct)
- Be willing to recommend a competitor, if the competitor has a better offering
- Welcome objections as a form of engagement
- Navigate the client's buying system
- Invest extra time in developing a lead
- View client lead streams strategically (quarterly, rather than weekly).
