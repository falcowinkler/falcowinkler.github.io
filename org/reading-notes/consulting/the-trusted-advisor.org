# Trusted Advisor
* The book
   - "trusted advisor" Well known term that was already widely used
   - First book 20 years before this, but very different because of profound impact of digitalization
   - Digital has profound impacts, but not the basics and dynamics of personal trust. Adapt digital to trust
   - Leadership is more about ability to influence, not charisma
   - Institutional trust became way more important
   - Trust is a very overlapping term in many sectors
   - Book is primarily about _interpersonal trust_
   - Focus on how trust is created
   - if trust is down, is it because less willingness to trust, or actually less trustworthiness?
   - Def. Trust: One kind of relationship between 2 persons. Increases if 1 person (the truster) increases risk by trusting the other persion,
     and the trustee becomes more trustworthy
   - Sole focus on trustworthiness is a mistake

* What is a trusted advisor?
  _There are levels to advisory_
  - Database of answers
  - Find solutions (the problem is seldom what the client says it is)
  - Broad strategy issues
  - Trusted advisor - all issues are open for discussion and exploration.
  The trusted advisor is a person the clients turn to as problems arise.
  The important part is to shift to any of the levels any time, not the amount of hours you spend on the levels

  - networking instead of just one trusted relationship
* Earning trust
  - Never label yourself as trustworthy

  - Trust can be lost very rapidly. Keep your self-interest in check

* How to give advice
  - Advice giving is almost never a logical process, but an emotional duett.
  - Need to earn the right to be critical
  - need to take sensitivity, emotions and politics into account
** _The clients perspective_
  - Can enter a consultant relationship with anxiety
  - An advisor usually reveils problems. That can be seen as creating more problems, if conveyed incorrectly.
  - Looking for reassurance, calming fear, sparking confidence.
  - Don't like being told what to do, unless advisor shows that they understand and respect them
    - Deep listening, take the time to understand the situation
  - Wants to feel in charge
  - primarily wants reasons, not instructions
  - Advisor shoud explain on eye-level with the client (regarding the skill/experience level in the matter)
** _Finding the right words_
  - prefer soft over hard phrasing
  - turn assertions into questions
  - Avoid situations where someone has to confess weakness
    - E.g. "Did everyone understand that? " vs "Have i made myself clear?"
    - "Would you like to stay on this point, or move to the next one?"
  - Trusted advisor assumes responsibility for mutual understanding
  - Avoid starting with Why?, has a judgemental edge. Strive for curiosity not judgement.
  - Rehearse a client conversation to understand how you are perceived
    - Rehease with a friend, colleague
    - Take a video
** _The teaches skills_
  - Where is the student starting from? For what messages are they ready? What do they believe in?
  - A lot of questioning and listening
  - Take on a journey of discovery
  - Socratic teaching
    - Why do you think we have this problem?
    - What would you do differently?
    - What advantages do the options have?
    - How do you think the relevant players would react?
    - Have you considered the adverse consequences of such an action?
    - Other people have encountered the following dificulties, how do you think we get around it?
    - What benefits do you see?
** _Dealing with client politics_
  - Make the client feel like it was their idea
  - Avoid taking a stance early
  - we are "A guide through the reasoning", show perspectives
  A good process for the advisor to follow is
  1. Give them their options
  2. Give them the education about the options
  3. Give them a reccomendation
  4. Let them choose
  - Many people are involved
  - Helpful to get all players on board beforehand, when a group decision is made
  - Conflicting agendas and schedules are also the advisors responsibility
** _Customizing your approach_
  - Consulting is a /performing/ art.
  - "The essence of advice-giving is the ability to design a process and means of interaction that fits each client situation".
  - Understand preferred style of interaction
* The rules of relationship building
- Tend to distinguish from our clients
- Effect can be they cut off our humanity, hindering the communication
** Key principles in relationship building
1. Go first
   + Give a favor to earn a favor
   + Need to take a risk
2. illustrate, don't tell
   + What you claim about yourself will always be perceived sceptically
   + Create opportunities to demonstrate, that you have something to contribute
   + Demonstrate that you
     1. Have listened to what the client has said
     2. have appreciated the importance the client has assigned to what they've been saying
     3. understand the unique aspects of their situation
     4. understand their business
     5. be a comfortable and supportive person to work with
     6. are able to make an unique contribution
     7. can be trusted to keep your word
     8. have experience in dealing with their problem
     Exercise: Pick 3 points that are most important, think about how you demonstrate them.
3. Listen for what's different, not for what's familiar
   What makes this person different from other clients?
   "What clients want" is a dangerous phrase, because clients want to be seen as individuals.
4. Be sure your advice is sought
   - provide affirmation, approval, support and appreciation along with your support
5. Earn the right to offer advice
   Be aware of stages in the relationship
   Three parts
   1. Understanding the clients situation
   2. Understanding how the client feels about it
   3. Convince the client that that we have achieved the previous two points
6. Keep asking
   - People tend to hint, and not communicate clearly.
   - Ask, and listen can not be emphasised enough
7. Say what you mean
   - Misunderstanding can be a big source of missed trust
8. When you need help, ask for it
   - Don't portray an image of complete mastery
   - Keeping the focus on the clients problem, builds trust
   - Demands are resented, requests for help are met with a positive response
9. Show an interest in the person
   - Keep them talking about themselves, to learn as much as possible how to adjust your communication
   - Invokes the feeling of "this person understands me"
   - Take notes
10. Use compliments, not flattery
   - Specific enough, sincere
11. Show appreciation

_Digital age_
Immitate, facilitate, and recreate the primal sense of being face-to-face with someone.
Suggestions to personalize digital communications
1. Guard against defaulting to the lowest emotional bandwith of communication
2. Exploit the capabilities of a given communications technology
3. Compensate for the limitations of the chosen technology
4. Make in-person meetings in the beginning
5. Brake the walls of your technology (e.g. find out the weather in a different locations)
6. Do your digital homework (find information about your communication partners)
7. Humanize yourself (give bits information about yourself)
* The Importance of mindsets
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or /mindsets/.
The most important ones are
1. Ability to focus on the other person
   - "You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
     goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"
   - This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
     (first you need to give /others/ what they want, in order to get what /you/ want.)
   - Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
   _Impediments_:
   - We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
   - It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
     and political depth
   - Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
   - To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
     because you stay focused on your own achievement
   - /Empathetic listening/ is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
     connect to how the other person feels.
2. Self confidence
   - Insecurity leads to loosing trust
   - Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
3. Ego strength
   - focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
   - don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
   - taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
   - (Cites Brene Brown)
   - Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
   - Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
   - Never engage the client in an argument
   - reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
4. Curiousity
   - "The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"
   - focus on the unknown
   - 
5. Inclusive professionalism
6. Principled behaviour
