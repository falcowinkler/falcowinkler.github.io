This paper is a bit old (2005) but summarizes well the different concepts around lineage retrieval,
which is relevant for end to end reproducibility of machine learning today.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The paper is very much focused on scientific applications (which is where the main need for reproducibility was in 2005).
</p>

<p>
Computing systems that store lineage have been developed since around 1985.
</p>

<p>
The paper differntiates between differend kinds of data processing.
</p>

<p>
Program, Query, Workflow or service-based.
</p>

<p>
Good definition of workflow and lineage
</p>

<p>
"Workflow is prospective in nature and defines plans for desired
processing. Lineage, on the other hand,
is retrospective like an audit [Becker and
Chambers 1988] and describes the relationships between data products and data
transformations after processing has occurred."
</p>

<p>
Lineage is "all the processes and transformations of data from original measurements to current form.".
And by definition, knowing lineage for a dataset means knowing its ancestory but also its descendants.
</p>

<p>
Lineage retrieval is problemeatic cause it's usually an afterthought, and no tooling is provided.
</p>

<p>
It gets more complex, the more sophisticated data processing techniques evolve.
</p>

<p>
There are some standards for lineage tracking, but they are quite specialized (e.g. on geographic data)
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> LINEAGE RETRIEVAL FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This chapter is categorized into different types of data processing system. this categorization
acknowledges the heterogenous nature of most processing systems, so it's a bit simplified.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Command Line-Based Data Processing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
One approach is to capture user commands along with their transformations automatically and record them
to a file, which can later be parsed and reveals the lineage.
</p>

<p>
Already in the 1990's there was work done on doing this with a metadatabase (for GIS data)
</p>

<p>
Another approach was to capture read and write processes from a shell and record and cache these files that are read and written.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Script- and Program-Based Data Processing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
One approach here is to use client apis within the scripts to weave in lineage tracking and later display the results in a web ui.
</p>

<p>
There's a couple of specialized algorithms for transformations in e.g. relational algebra or the "Array Transformation language"
(see also here <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=775456&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=775456&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL</a>)
</p>

<p>
The system goose takes the approach of enforcing registration of any data objects within the system before allowing to 
transform it.

<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> WFMS-Based Data Processing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Here the Geo-Opera extension of the OPERA kernel (whatever that is) is described as an example
of a workflow based system. the user registeres internal or external data objects and configures a workflow
through a graphical interface.

<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Query-Based Data Processing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
This category is similar to whats described here <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=775456&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=775456&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL</a>.
The idea is to do all transformations in a dbms and register all transformation functions within the system, along with their inverse.
Problems with that is integration between different systems, as well as the fact most transformations are not invertible without much effort.

<h3 id="sec-3-5"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Service-Based Data Processing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
The Chimera Virtual Data System (VDS) can execute data transformation written in a specific language on a grid.
These requests and their effects are stored and can be queried. 
Chimera defines the concept of "virtual data", it is capable of generating transformation DAG's that regenerate a dataset.
</p>

<p>
Another approach builds metadata out of workflow execution logs.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> RELATED RESEARCH: COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND EXPERIMENT MANAGEMENT</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The information lifecycle for an experiment consists of
data acquisition, or retrieval both before and after conducting experiments, 
and data analysis, exploration, or visualization of experimental results
</p>

<p>
There exist a variety of software that attempts to fully encompass this lifecycle.
These systems often have a graphical interface and shield the user from low-level stuff.
</p>

<p>
When not using a computer in scientific research, the use of paper notebooks was common,
and it was subject to some regulations, for example attestations had to be made for notebook pages,
in order to prove the presence of scientific knowledge at the time, eg. for patents.
</p>

<p>
Some software tries to replicate this in digital form. In the prototype ViNE researchers have to 
register the location of their flatfiles, and define a DAG transformation in a web interface.
An execution controller can then execute the program and share results.
</p>

<p>
in the Virtual Laboratory Notebook metadata is automatically tracked as a researcher 
conducts experiments. It tracks variations of one experiment as a tree.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> RELATED RESEARCH: WORKFLOWS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Def. "Workflows
are activities involving the coordinated
execution of multiple tasks performed by
different processing entities"
</p>

<p>
So a workflow is constructed <i>before</i> an experiment, and after that
the lineage is navigated.
</p>

<p>
There are many many workflow definition languages and execution languages,
in the 2000s there were attemots to standardize that.
</p>

<p>
Sharing workflows through webservers did not yet evolve at the time.
The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services is deemed promising,
along with the Web Services Choreog- raphy Description Language.

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> VERSION MANAGEMENT</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Version management, known also as ver- sion or revision control, 
is used for tracking modifications to files or objects (particularly documents,
 application code components, and database records) over time.
</p>

<p>
The paper references a vcs from 1993 "Concurrent Versions System (CVS) [Cederqvist 1993]"
</p>

<p>
VCS applicable per repository, for connections between related objects Config management 
is needed
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of version management for data is acknowledged.
Some approaches use version management on metadata graphs that describe
connections between datasets.

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Lineage metamodel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
The paper concluded with the definition of a metamodel for lineage retrieval 
system design.
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the model is the workflow, that publishes
data items over time along with their metadata and lineage metadata.
Metadata and lineage metadata may or may not be in distinct systems.
</p>

<p>
The metadata has to be structured in a way that 
lineage retrieval requires the capability to
 assemble a retrospective view of workflow using extant metadata.
