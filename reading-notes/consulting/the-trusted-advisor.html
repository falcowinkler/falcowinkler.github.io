Exercise: Pick 3 points that are most important, think about how you demonstrate them.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listen for what's different, not for what's familiar
What makes this person different from other clients?
"What clients want" is a dangerous phrase, because clients want to be seen as individuals.
</li>
<li>Be sure your advice is sought
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>provide affirmation, approval, support and appreciation along with your support
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Earn the right to offer advice
Be aware of stages in the relationship
Three parts
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Understanding the clients situation
</li>
<li>Understanding how the client feels about it
</li>
<li>Convince the client that that we have achieved the previous two points
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Keep asking
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People tend to hint, and not communicate clearly.
</li>
<li>Ask, and listen can not be emphasised enough
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Say what you mean
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Misunderstanding can be a big source of missed trust
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you need help, ask for it
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't portray an image of complete mastery
</li>
<li>Keeping the focus on the clients problem, builds trust
</li>
<li>Demands are resented, requests for help are met with a positive response
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show an interest in the person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep them talking about themselves, to learn as much as possible how to adjust your communication
</li>
<li>Invokes the feeling of "this person understands me"
</li>

<h2 id="sec-10"><span class="section-number-2">10</span> The Importance of mindsets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or <i>mindsets</i>.
The most important ones are
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ability to focus on the other person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"
</li>
<li>This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
(first you need to give <i>others</i> what they want, in order to get what <i>you</i> want.)
</li>
<li>Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="underline">Impediments</span>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
</li>
<li>It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
and political depth
</li>
<li>Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
</li>
<li>To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
because you stay focused on your own achievement
</li>
<li><i>Empathetic listening</i> is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
connect to how the other person feels.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self confidence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Insecurity leads to loosing trust
</li>
<li>Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego strength
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
</li>
<li>don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
</li>
<li>taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
</li>
<li>(Cites Brene Brown)
</li>
<li>Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
</li>
<li>Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
</li>
<li>Never engage the client in an argument
</li>
<li>reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curiosity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"
</li>
<li>focus on the unknown
</li>
<li>attitute that drives the opportunity to contribute
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inclusive professionalism
We should not distinguish ourselves from the clients
This would reinforce wrong believes such as
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>our job is to solve problems, rather than to help solve problems
</li>
<li>advisors control client interactions and relationships, as opposed to inhabiting them jointly.
</li>
<li>joint responsibility for the effectiveness of work
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principled behaviour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Relationships vs transactions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nothing wrong with transactional collaboration, key is to give choice
</li>
<li>Relationships force to focus, and be selective in whom you build relationships
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long term vs short term perspectives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short term focus and priority on self-interest harm long-term perspectives
</li>
<li>Long term are a series of short-term goals, both will be maximized by focus on long-tearm goals.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Metavalue defined by Consistency on other values
</li>
<li>consistency is sometimes more important than which values you pick
</li>
</ul>
