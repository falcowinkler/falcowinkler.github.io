<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or <i>mindsets</i>.
The most important ones are
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ability to focus on the other person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"

<li>This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
(first you need to give <i>others</i> what they want, in order to get what <i>you</i> want.)
</li>
<li>Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="underline">Impediments</span>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
</li>
<li>It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
and political depth
</li>
<li>Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
</li>
<li>To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
because you stay focused on your own achievement
</li>
<li><i>Empathetic listening</i> is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
connect to how the other person feels.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self confidence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Insecurity leads to loosing trust
</li>
<li>Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
</li>

</li>
<li>Ego strength
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
</li>
<li>don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
</li>
<li>taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
</li>
<li>(Cites Brene Brown)
</li>
<li>Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
</li>
<li>Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
</li>
<li>Never engage the client in an argument
</li>
<li>reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curiosity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"

</li>
<li>attitute that drives the opportunity to contribute

We should not distinguish ourselves from the clients

<li>joint responsibility for the effectiveness of work

</ul>

<li>Principled behaviour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Relationships vs transactions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nothing wrong with transactional collaboration, key is to give choice
</li>
<li>Relationships force to focus, and be selective in whom you build relationships
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long term vs short term perspectives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short term focus and priority on self-interest harm long-term perspectives

<span class="underline">Final tips on enhancing credibility</span>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">

</li>
<li>Don't tell lies or exaggerate, ever
</li>
<li>Avoid saying things that can be construed as lies.
</li>
<li>Speak with expression, not monotonically. Show your energy
</li>
<li>Don't just cite references. You can also connect your clients if it's beneficial.
</li>
<li>If you are unsure, admit it quickly and empathically.
</li>
<li>Have them know your credentials. be careful with adjectives.
</li>
<li>Relax. You know more than you think you do.
</li>

<li>Improves the better you know the person

Final thoughts

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Biggest sources of differentiation in trustworthiness are intimacy and low self-orientation
</li>
<li>Know how to emphasize with someone, but also know how to communicate this

</li>
<li>A safe haven for tough issues
</li>
<li>People can get very personal, intimate and irrational

Suggestions

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be not afraid. Intimacy requires courage for everyone involved.
</li>
<li>Candor is not necessarily intimacy.

<li>Show that you have a different angle, ask questions unheard of from other consultants.
Both parties will have fun and learn
</li>
<li>Test if you are about to cross the line. Ask if the client would even want to discuss
an intimate issue with you, by putting yourself in their shoes.
Can the client exit the situation while saving face? Is it the correct time, topic and phrasing?
</li>
<li>Practice phrasing of difficult questions, messages etc.
</li>
<li>Don't overrate the downside risk. It is often overstated and sometimes, it is actually your personal risk.
