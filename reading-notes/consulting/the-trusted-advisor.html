<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"trusted advisor" Well known term that was already widely used
</li>
<li>First book 20 years before this, but very different because of profound impact of digitalization
</li>
<li>Digital has profound impacts, but not the basics and dynamics of personal trust. Adapt digital to trust
</li>
<li>Leadership is more about ability to influence, not charisma
</li>
<li>Institutional trust became way more important
</li>
<li>Trust is a very overlapping term in many sectors
</li>
<li>Book is primarily about <span class="underline">interpersonal trust</span>
</li>
<li>Focus on how trust is created
</li>
<li>if trust is down, is it because less willingness to trust, or actually less trustworthiness?
</li>
<li>Def. Trust: One kind of relationship between 2 persons. Increases if 1 person (the truster) increases risk by trusting the other persion,
and the trustee becomes more trustworthy
</li>
<li>Sole focus on trustworthiness is a mistake

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Skills alone are not enough
A trusted advisor must develop appropiate attituted or <i>mindsets</i>.
The most important ones are
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ability to focus on the other person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"You'll have more fun and success by focusing on helping other people accomplish their
goals than you will by focusing on your own goals"
</li>
<li>This aphorism sounds socialistic but is actually captitalistic ( 😅 )
(first you need to give <i>others</i> what they want, in order to get what <i>you</i> want.)
</li>
<li>Conclusively it's important to find out what the other person wants.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="underline">Impediments</span>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We often come from purely technical positions, with fears we might not be able enough to satisfy the client
</li>
<li>It can be unsettling to find out that what the client actually wants is that their problem is understood, in all it's complexity
and political depth
</li>
<li>Technical excellence can sometimes even be an impediment
</li>
<li>To be "Driven, rational and meritocratic with a great need to achieve" is not helpful for learning to build trust,
because you stay focused on your own achievement
</li>
<li><i>Empathetic listening</i> is a crucial skill, but it forces you to leave your own desire for self promotion behind, and truly
connect to how the other person feels.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self confidence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Insecurity leads to loosing trust
</li>
<li>Necessary to focus your attention to listening and understanding
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego strength
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>focus on the consultative relationship process, and the matter at hand
</li>
<li>don't we wedded to who get's the credit 😉
</li>
<li>taking on personal responsibility (but not about things you can not control)
</li>
<li>(Cites Brene Brown)
</li>
<li>Secrecy, silence and judgement grow shame
</li>
<li>Response to a Fundamental challenge to our very core depends on why the client has said such a thing
</li>
<li>Never engage the client in an argument
</li>
<li>reflect on and rehearse reactions to such situations
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curiosity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"The right to solve problems is earned by informed listening, which in turn is driven by curiosity"
</li>
<li>focus on the unknown
</li>
<li>attitute that drives the opportunity to contribute
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inclusive professionalism
We should not distinguish ourselves from the clients
This would reinforce wrong believes such as
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>our job is to solve problems, rather than to help solve problems
</li>
<li>advisors control client interactions and relationships, as opposed to inhabiting them jointly.
</li>
<li>joint responsibility for the effectiveness of work
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Principled behaviour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Relationships vs transactions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nothing wrong with transactional collaboration, key is to give choice
</li>
<li>Relationships force to focus, and be selective in whom you build relationships
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long term vs short term perspectives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Short term focus and priority on self-interest harm long-term perspectives
</li>
<li>Long term are a series of short-term goals, both will be maximized by focus on long-tearm goals.

<li>Test if you are about to cross the line. Ask if the client would even want to discuss
an intimate issue with you, by putting yourself in their shoes.
Can the client exit the situation while saving face? Is it the correct time, topic and phrasing?
</li>
<li>Practice phrasing of difficult questions, messages etc.

Nearly every techique and concept so far is often perceived as risky and thus infeasible.
Often <i>business risk</i> is often, after close examination, <i>personal risk</i>.

<p>
Generalising clients is tempting, but dangerous and wrong.
How can we regognize and deal with the various type of clients?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Work in advance on what is different about this client, and what might be different about you in this situation.
Make sure that there is complete understanding on what you are supposed to do for a client, before walking into a meeting.
</li>
<li>As you look at the client, force yourself to ask three questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is the client's prevailing personal motivation?
</li>
<li>What is their personality?
</li>
<li>How does the state of their organization affect their world view?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When thinking about a clients pervailing personal motivation, which comes first?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the need to excel
</li>
<li>the need to take action and achieve results
</li>
<li>The need to understand and analyse before deciding
</li>
<li>The need to drive consensus
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tailor your conversation to a specific outcome
</p>
</li>
<li>Figure out why you might truly like this client as a person
</li>
<li>Use the trust equation. Look at how the client weighs the factors.
Ask:  How highly does the client value&#x2026;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>me for my objective unbiased clear opinions? (Credibility)
</li>
<li>me for my track record, for my integrity of doing what i said i'd do?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-24-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Just the facts"
Don't be fooled: This is a plea to be understood. 
Speak in the clients language. 
Use clarifying and confirming statements.
</li>
<li>"I'll get back to you"
This is typically a client nervous about commitments on the spot, conservative, afraid of being wrong.
Make that process easier for them. Legitimize their desire for "soak time".
</li>
<li>"You're the expert, dummy"
They are giving in to their inclination to dominate you. Give back value in the form of a number of hypothesis.
</li>
<li>"Let me handle that"
The language of a client that doesn't trust you. Apply the trust process.
It can also be that the client doesn't trust anyone -&gt; Naming and claiming.
</li>
<li>"Let's go through this again"
Frame via alternatives: Clients like this are most comfortable in the detail-oriented realm.
This might mask a desire to control things. The goal is to make the situation feel controllable.
</li>
<li>"You don't understand"
Might be a desire to feel special. Don't try to win the battle, acknowledge your differences and ask questions
</li>
<li>"The enemy's enemy is my friend"
These clients love politics. Speak their language. Don't debate the value of what they are saying.
Make politics a content issue and talk about it freely.
</li>
<li>"Just like, you know, come on. Make it happen"
Skills not in the verbal area, but often they have balancing strength. Help them, give them voice.
Write down, make lists, allow them to rank things etc.
</li>
<li>"Oh by the way&#x2026; i probably should have&#x2026;"
Are you consistently missing out? It could be a personal issue, or a label for you.
Ask for a private meeting, assume that you have a label. Use naming and claiming, ask to put them in your shoes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-25">
<p>
Many professionals are terrible negotiators,
because selling has a negative connotation (or stereotype).
</p>

<p>
Imagine youself as the buyer of a complex and emotionally charged service (e.g. will).
You are anxious as the service is important to you and you know less about the price than the other party.
Imagine if the seller
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seems to have your best interest at heart
</li>
<li>Seeks to understand your interest
</li>
<li>Offers advice that is useful to you
</li>
<li>Doesn't seem to try to get you to buy
</li>
<li>Is driven by your calender, not theirs
</li>
<li>Isn't wedded to this transaction
</li>
<li>Is transparent and honest
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This sounds familiar to values of client delivery! So we don't have to cross over to the dark side.

<li>Stop trying to close the deal
</li>
<li>Be transparent and consistent about our pricing
</li>
<li>Be much less attached to the outcome (view sale as a byproduct)

<li>Be willing to recommend a competitor, if the competitor has a better offering
</li>
<li>Welcome objections as a form of engagement
</li>
<li>Navigate the client's buying system
</li>
<li>Invest extra time in developing a lead

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-28-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Expand:
New service is offered to a current client individual.
"Handing over the business card" scenario is problematic, since
it feels like the advisor is asking a favor and setting people up.
Extensive trust building and to demonstrate that one has the best interest
of all parties at heart, are key in this type.
</li>
<li>Broaden:
Existing service is offered to a new person in the client organization.
"I just need an intro" scenario is problematic if it seems like the client is taken for granted.
No risk is taken from the advisors side, and not much is said about the client side.
-&gt; Share an honest view of how the interests of client and advisor are intertwined.
"What's in it for me" question must be answered for the client.
</li>
<li>Diversify:
New service to a new person.
Problematic since there are 4 relationships and 4 parties involved.
Start by talking to the internal expert. Then talk to the client and further define the problem.
The real meeting will be much less problematic if it's clear that
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>all parties invested serious time
</li>
<li>the problem is well understood
</li>
<li>the expertise is real and known
</li>
<li>everyones interest is genuine

<li>everyone knows each other
